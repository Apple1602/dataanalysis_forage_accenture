This is a repo to showcase my data analysis using the forage accenture dataset.

A data analyst sits between the business and the data.

The Business refers to the client and your internal team members who wonâ€™t be involved in detailed data analysis.
They rely on your analysis to make strategic business decisions.
Importantly, not everyone will have a strong understanding of data. Your job is to communicate your data findings simply and clearly for everyone to understand.

The Data refers to the relevant data sources that you will clean, process, and use to generate interesting insights for the business.
